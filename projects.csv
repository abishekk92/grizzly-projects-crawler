During the last year, we kept running into situations where doing simple things just wasn't so simple for a regular user as we felt it should be. We thought something was wrong as we often had to answer questions with: ""Oh, we use the CLI for that"" or ""Our dev made a script that we use"". So we decided to slowly start solving that problem, both for ourselves and everyone else interested in doing cool things on Solana.
We made a list of basic things we felt are missing a (noob-friendly) GUI, or aren't accessible even through CLI.
From that list, BlastCtrl Tools were born (https://tools.blastctrl.com). The list kept getting longer and we plan on adding more things as fast as our bandwidth allows."

It's a RTS game where you attack other lands and defend yours. Players share a prize pool according to their performance, at the end of each month.
Game Has an NFT collection that owners aside from normal trading/flipping can stake their NFT and earn $LOLB 🤑, in-game currency of the main RTS game. On the other hand, players can purchase this $LOLB to buy and sell skins, items, lands and other cool stuff 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼.
Sounds awesome right 😻? but where does the prize pool come from 🤑?
After initial minting of our NFT collection we would use the raised fund to trade in very low risk and profitable strategies. Normally after a month of trading and compounding profits we expect to have 30% to 50% profits. now depending on state of project and decisions of team size of prize pool would be announced and holders of NFTs and players would receive their shares.
Please note that on the paper prize pool grows each month as we make more profits and use the profits for trading and so on🤑😻.
The news about daily profits and losses would be published for clarity and for community to speculate on the real value of our NFTs. In other words in case of profits NFTs will go up📈💹 and in case of losses some may decide to sell📉.
We don't believe in eating out our community by greedy fees and unfair royalties😠. That's why profits come from trading and not from within the community🚀. We value our community and reward long holders, gamers and contributors❤️🫶🎁.
Aside from all of these monetary stuff, we deliver a super fun web3 game and experience🚀 follow us for upcoming new at twitter: https://twitter.com/landoflandless"

The fact that Solana's developer kit only actually functions on macOS and a very limited number of Linux distros poses a significant barrier to access from the outset. You're out of luck if you're one of the 60 to 70 percent of developers who use Windows or a Linux distribution other than Ubuntu. And this is a really real problem: Some of my friends who recently started working on Such applications required a day to set up their development environment; others spent a week; and yet others had to buy a brand-new laptop. In essence, Alon is a superior remix of Solana. Developers can quickly build, iterate, test, and release decentralised apps and assets on Solana right from their browser using the Alon IDE, which is powered by a WebAssembly copy of the Solana compiler suite. Alon is able to reduce the time it takes to compile, run, and test Solana programmes down to a few hundred milliseconds by writing a very thin compiler and linker frontend on top of a Web Assembly port of Solana's compiler suite and by writing a basic JavaScript port of Solana's programme virtual machine syscalls.Alon really makes it so quick to compile and run tests for Solana programmes that we created a choice to have Alon do these things automatically.","https://github.com/mattnite/solana-bpf

A Truly On-Chain P2P Betting Platform. All The Funds Are Managed In A Complete Trustless Way On-Chain. DAO Will Add New Matches And Update The Match States Thus Providing Decentralization To The Whole Experience.
We Are Still Building The DAO, More Updates Coming Soon.
We Are Using The Chips Model, Wherein Users Will Have To Exchange SOL For Blinders Tokens Which Will Be Used For Betting. We Aim To Generate Profit That Will Be Needed To Sustain The Platform Using Our Token Model And Token Exchange Rates.
One of the key features of Blinders is its trustless fund management system, which ensures that all funds are securely managed in a transparent and decentralized way.
When a user places a bet on Blinders, the funds are transferred to a trustless escrow account. This process is completely trustless, meaning that users do not have to rely on a centralized authority or third-party intermediary to manage the funds.
This escrow account is managed by the blockchain itself, which automatically executes the terms of the transaction."

Natural Disasters,Wildfires,Tsunamis,Earthquakes,Cyclones,Floods,Tornadoes,Terror Attacks,
Solution Approach Where lies the Problem
People donate less No trust on the organizations They don’t get anything in return Sometimes It takes weeks to raise the minimum amount needed Average person gets aware in around 24 hours Spreading awareness consumes majority of time Some people are ready to contribute but don’t have funds on time What if they raised 100k but only used 80k? No one knows But the donors have a right to know
Presenting Decentralized Funding Blocks Application
Donors can raise fund before a calamity has occurred They get Certificate for donation as NFT Funds cannot be stolen They cannot be withdrawn without any need
Total amount collected is always transparent The total time can be just a couple of minutes Donors vote for the amount to be withdrawn Amount withdrawn is fully transparent
Funds Transfer - Donors vote for the withdraw amount The voting process continues until 25% of the total donors have voted or 50% have downvoted it If ≥ 50% have downvoted, the Funding Block is canceled Else, the funds are transferred to the organisation.",https://fundingblocks.ml/

While several blockchain games are just coming aboard the NFT train by tokenizing their weapons as game NFTs, we have numerous games that are purely centered on tradable collectibles. These games are usually modeled after traditional games racing, football, arcade, strategy, and even virtual worlds. The NFTs can be anything from tracks, cars, characters, costumes, and tires in racing games; player cards, manager packs, jerseys, etc., in football games. In virtual worlds or simulation games, users can purchase pieces of virtual land, develop properties and run businesses, and interact with other users using avatars.

We are creating a framework to encourage everyone to host fun events and design cool locations for a bustling downtown. The distribution of real estate and token incentives will make sure that the city core is crowded and fascinating for new users to explore.",https://demo.theportal.to/demo

We are ardent DeFi users, and we know yield matters. Yield, which is delivered by protocols to their active participants as payment for rendering essential services to the network, is the lifeblood of DeFI. For instance, AMMs (such as Saber and Raydium) pay trading commissions to liquidity providers. Lenders are compensated with interest via credit marketplaces (like Solend). Protocols utilising tokenized proof-of-stake, such as Marinade and Lido, incentivize stakeholder behaviour. DeFi yield is distributed using specific yield-bearing tokens, commonly referred to as ""LP tokens"". These yield-bearing tokens incorporate two undesirable qualities notwithstanding their value: Interest rate turbulence: erratic and fluctuating yield rates Capital inefficiency: Until they are redeemed, yield-generating deposits are locked, preventing profitable use elsewhere. It's crucial to remember that these drawbacks are not a coincidence. They come from processes that adapt interest rates in response to changes in market forces, ensuring that DeFi protocols continue to be viable and competitive.

Content creators cannot immediately access the donations they receive by having to wait for the stipulated date; the percentage that companies keep from donations is very high; the creators have directed their followers to chat groups but do not have a friendly function for their followers to send them donations from any country. Therefore, receiving donations in crypto and easily converting them into fiat money through the Decaf application using SOLdador is a solution that all content creators should use in their communities.

“During our clinical trial we saw an opportunity to make clinical trials more inclusive, secure, and transparent. It's very difficult to scout people and the process takes years.”
We started DataX after winning the Digicampus hackathon from the Dutch government. We won a validation pilot where we used this time to create an MVP of DataX with Solana smart contracts. Besides that, we did the first validation steps of DataX in collaboration with the Validation Lab from YES!Delft. This accelerator is from the Dutch government where they help startups that creates products that have a big impact on our society. Next to that, we are working close with the Dutch Blockchain Coalition which is the highest organization in the Netherlands for blockchain (https://dutchblockchaincoalition.org/en).

Mobile Wallet Adaptor and Seed Vault compatible.,"(a) Functionality: Test the app with APK provided. GitLab repo access on request.
(b) Potential Impact: TT trading wallet will have all Solana DEXes in an integrated environment: Openbook, Mango, Phoenix, Drift, Zeta, Cypher. Users from mobile only countries in South East Asia and Africa, will be able to participate in DeFi, based on cheap and inclusive Solana network.
(c) Novelty: TT brings DeFi to mobile. Wallets are usually browser extensions or limited in functionality mobile apps. TT is a native specialized wallet that allows trading on DEXes, finding yield opportunities for dormant portfolio assets, getting into crypto quickly with credit card onramp, staying up-to-date of your portfolio and a broad market with push notification alerts.
(d) UX: TT wallet is only possible on Solana CLOB based DEXes. It allows the same expected speed of execution as TradFi and CeFi in a decentralized mobile environment.
(e) Open-source: GitLab repo access on request. Android client can be made open-source, when ready.
(f) Business Plan: Business model is based on rebates, a premium subscription and developer API. Solana DEXes rebate 50% of trading fees to user interfaces, and sometimes allow charging own GUI fee. Premium subscription allows power users to access premium trading features and remove limits on certain user generated items (alerts, watchlists etc). Developer API allows a single live streaming endpoint for all markets, historical data for trades and candles, execution API for trading across multiple venues."

We have a new UI for the hackathon but getting a developer willing to work on the backend without pay was a problem. The demo was from a previous backend guy who took out the codes because we were unable to complete payment for work done. what we currently have on the github is the new updated UI for KalloView. Thank for the opportunity and I hope we can win or get a memorable mention from Solana

We want to offer the world an unprecedented experience in gaming with our own interpretations and contributions to the trending and rapidly growing Digital reality in the world.,"PARS emerged in 2018 with a fantasy universe story style. As of this year, respectively; The story continued to be developed as a game and universe. The letters of the name PARS mean (Poly Augmented Reality System) in order. As the name suggests, PARS aims to create an XR universe by using Augmented Reality technology with multi-user method and wearable technology. We call the name of this complex universe we will create, PARAVERSE. Metaverse tries to adapt people to a universe that is physically and socially detached from reality, while PARAVERSE adapts the digital elements we design to the real world.
PARAVERSE includes: An RTS (Real Time Strategy) card game called The Legend of Acun, a PAR Map where you can collect objects and gifts while walking on the street, a large in-game and non-game NFT market, its own Crypto Token system, the opportunity to create your own content with Web 3.0 , More AR plug-ins with the PARS Engine engine, the opportunity to participate in digital events at the same time with people you do not know in the world, Cafe AR, Book AR, PARSVille, RP Module and many more plug-ins...
PARS aims to introduce AR technology, which is new for humanity, to the world through a game we will create (T LOA). In this way, it will break people's prejudice against new technologies and create the appropriate environment for PARAVERSE. While the universe is being activated, we aim to be a pioneer in this sector (XR) with our R&D studies in wearable technology.
All feasibility studies related to PARS have been documented and we have long analysis reports on this subject. These; Strategic Reports, 5-Year Income — Expense Accounts, PARS Token, Feasibility Report, T LOA etc. are such topics. We would like to share these files with you down to the smallest detail. You know Turkey's recent success in the gaming industry, we believe that PARAVERSE Universe, Web 3.0, AR Strategy, Cryptocurrency System and RTS Card Game will undoubtedly be the industry of the future. If you think like us and want to learn more about this formation, which is the combination of all of them, we will be waiting to hear from you.

We call this network the Cloud9Network. Thru agreements and partnerships we have successfully created the first web3 cannabis network. This includes licensed grow op from around the world involved with these perspective projects. Scaling cannabis utilities for mass adoption, was always going to be the greater issue in the known future ahead. The Cloud9network, although young in development as of only 2 weeks ago, it has found its uses well beyond just the cannabis industry. Finally, we're working on creating a self governing industry council for cannabis NFT's. 420 Club has established the Cannabis Collective Council to establish industry standards and ethics in this developing industry.

Some prominent features of Libranium include:
The plans of the organization and the company will be made public and can be voted on by all members of the company, rather than being decided by the top group. However, internal ranks will still be reflected through the amount of tokens provided, and the more tokens there are, the greater the voting value.
Increase transparency for the company's financial system. For example, salary bonuses will be listed based on electronic contracts, which means the money is only transferred when the output matches the number on the contract.
Increase integrity in proposing ideas: Each individual will be provided with an account and will input their ideas on the platform. The entered ideas will have electronic code representing ownership of that account (similar to NFTs) and cannot be edited by others.
Libranium aims to solve the following issues:
Currently, transparency is a major issue within the company. Many decisions made by the leadership are subjective and sometimes aimed at individuals, negatively impacting some employees. In addition, suspicion in the workplace also hinders the development of a work culture, thus limiting the potential of collective strength.
Ensuring fairness as a way to build long-term relationships with employees is also becoming a trend. The phenomenon of ""stealing work"" or ""not contributing directly to the final decision"" creates an indifferent attitude and a lack of creative motivation. Many good but risky ideas are not put forward because their owners are afraid of being criticized or that their ideas won't change the final decision when the power is concentrated in the hands of a few people.
How will Libranium solve these issues?
All members will participate in a transparent public vote. From there, each individual will have a greater motivation to research the issue due to their responsibility for the ballot. They know that when the result falls, the ballot cannot be changed and they must protect their views in front of the public. In addition, according to the principle of the game, when each member holds a part of the management system, they will work together to improve the management work.
Transparent financial statements help build trust within the organization. The electronic contract system ensures that salaries are paid based on output, not just words. As a result, everyone will work harder to achieve better results, and Libranium's contribution to the business will be recognized and appreciated by everyone.",Live Demo: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yNUkQd4vWGZROJ07N5f0X4m4j4oSKtxa?usp=share_link
